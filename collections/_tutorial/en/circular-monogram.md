This tutorial is not using Ink/Stich Lettering
{: .notice--info }

This method does not allow for small letters (aiming to 5cm hight is good)
{: .notice--warning }

To create the starting paths you may either use one of the monogram fonts already installed on your computer, for example
[this one](https://www.dafont.com/round-monogram.font), 
or use one of the websites allowing you to create monogram such as 
[that one](https://www.makemonogram.com/monogram-maker)

This was the starting point

## Circular Fill Letters
 
If you used a system font, don't forget to convert the text into an object

Now you only need to:

* Select the 3 paths that correspond to the 3 letters (they should be fill, no stroke)
* `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Params`
* Chose Circular Fill as method
  *  disable underpath
  *  from the underlay tab, disable underlay
  *  and chose your favorite parameters

![parametres](/assets/images/tutorials/circular_monogram/parameters.jpg)

Each letter is filled with circles centered on the letter own center.

To get all circles from all letters to share the same center, use target position:


* Select all 3 letters and lower their opacity
* `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Commands > Add command to selected objects`
* Chose "Target position" and Apply
* On the canvas, move the 3 command symbols till their markers are overimposed.
* Run Simulation and enjoy the result
 
## Satin Border
 
The 4th path is also a fill , to turn it into a satin column :
 
 
 * `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Tools:Stroke > Fill to Stroke`
 * Uncheck everything and Apply
 
 ![after_fill_to_stroke](/assets/images/tutorials/circular_monogram/fill_to_stroke.jpg)
 
  Select the newly created path
 
 * `Path> Simplify`
 
 * `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Tools: Satin > Stroke to  Live Path Effect Satin`

 ![satin_path_effet_before](/assets/images/tutorials/circular_monogram/satin_path_effect_before.jpg)
 
 * Apply
 
  ![satin_path_effet_after](/assets/images/tutorials/circular_monogram/satin_path_effect_after.jpg)
  
  * Close Stroke to Live path effect Satin

To modify the satin pattern

with the satin border still selected :
 
 * Path> Path Effect
 * Click on  "Modify on canvas" in Pattern source

 ![satin_path_effet_after](/assets/images/tutorials/circular_monogram/pattern_before.jpg)
 
 * Modify the pattern: here one rail was flattend and width was increased.
![satin_path_effet_after](/assets/images/tutorials/circular_monogram/pattern_after.jpg)

Modification's effect  is immediatly seen on the canvas.

Embroidery is  ready. You may keep the live path effect Satin for further modifications.
