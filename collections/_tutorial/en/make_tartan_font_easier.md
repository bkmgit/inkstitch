Tartan fonts yield very colorful results, but to get them one must change threads very often.
It is very easy to get a slightly less colorfl result (with a single tartan on all letters) with muchh fewer thread
changes.


For instance, writing PRIMAVERA with Emilio 20 Tartan yields :

But if instead one uses a single tartan for all letters

one get a very easier stitchout

Much fewer color changes. But some long jumps in between letters. This method is best used with a machine that cuts thread.

Checking "Cut after" in the tartan fill parameters windows (not tartan extension, but params) will then do the trick.

It is quite easy:
* Use Emilio 20 Tartan font
* Select all Tartan Fill (this are all the red fills, you may select one and then use Inkscape > Edition > Select Same >Fill Colo
* Inkscape > Parh > Combine
* Move the resulting shape so that it is embroidered first.
* Ink/Stitch > Tools : Fill  > [Tartan](/docs/fill-tools/#tartan) and chose your own settings.

You may also use a different fill on the combined shape, in particular a
[linear gradient fill](/docs/stitches/linear-gradient-fill)
