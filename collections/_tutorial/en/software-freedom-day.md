## Steps

1. Download the Software Freedom Day Logo file from
   https://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org/Logo

2. Open the file in Inkscape and delete all content other than the squarish
   logo, delete content by object rather than by group since some of the groups
   are linked

3. Using `File>Document Properties...`, Change the background color to black,
   and resize the document

4. Using `Layer>Layers and Objects...` Re-arrange the objects so that they are
   grouped by colors, green, yellow and red. By grouping the same colors
   together, you will minimize the number of times the embroidery machine needs
   to change the thread. Label them appropriately.  You will likely need to
   ungroup paths and then group them together appropriately.

5. Using `Object>Fill and Stroke...` give all yellow objects a uniform stroke of
   RGB (249,213,35), and no fill. The green hill should have a uniform fill of
   RGB (57,181,54), and no stroke. The red part of the 'f' should have a uniform
   stroke of RGB (241,90,36) and no fill.

6. Select the green hill, then choose `Extensions>Ink/Stitch>Params...`, then
   give it a contour fill, going from inner to outer. Leave other parameters
   as default.

7. Select the red bar, and zoom into it.  As it is a polygon, and we want to use
   a satin stitch, we will need to replace it with paths.  Select the 
   `Bezier curves and straght lines` tool and overlay the top and bottom parts
   of the polygon with two straight lines both going from left to right. Color
   these lines with RGB (241,90,36). Then delete the polygon.  To ensure a nice
   stitch finish, we want the beginning and end lock stitches to be hidden.
   Select the `Edit paths by nodes tool`, the select all nodes on the two red
   lines and add choose `Insert new nodes into selected segments`.  This will
   add a node on each path midway between the end nodes.  Choose these new
   nodes, and select `Break path at selected nodes`. Then in the
   `Layers>Layers and objects...` duplicate these lines, choose the bottom
   part to be left and delete the rightmost nodes, choose the other part to be
   right and delete the leftmost nodes. Finally, choose the
   `Bezier curves and straight lines` tool again and add a small horizontal
   dotted line going from right to left, between the lines forming the left
   segment.  This line will be the start of the stitching, and will have a lock
   stitch that will be hidden.

   Select the right part of, then go to `Path>Reverse`.  With the right part
   still selected, choose `Extensions>Ink/Stitch>Params` and choose a custom
   satin stitch with and end lock stitch, but not a beginning lock stitch. Do
   also add Zig-zag Underlay.

   Select the left part, choose `Extensions>Ink/Stitch>Params` and choose a
   custom satin stitch with no lock stitches, and add a Zig-Zag Underlay.

   ![Screen shot of stitches for left part of red part of f](/assets/images/tutorials/software-freedom-day/SFDTutorial7.png)

   Select the dotted starting line, choose `Extensions>Ink/Stitch>Params` and
   ensure there is a starting lock stitch, but no ending lock stitch.

8. Select the sun.  Break it up into three non intersecting but adjacent paths
   with equal numbers of nodes.

   ![Screen shot of top part of sun](/assets/images/tutorials/software-freedom-day/SFDTutorial9.png)

   ![Screen shot of right part of sun](/assets/images/tutorials/software-freedom-day/SFDTutorial10.png)

   ![Screen shot of bottom part of sun](/assets/images/tutorials/software-freedom-day/SFDTutorial11.png)

   Add a starting segment at the beginning of the bottom part of the sun to
   allow for a hidden lock stitch

   ![Screen shot of starting segment of sun](/assets/images/tutorials/software-freedom-day/SFDTutorial12.png)

   Break off the last part of the top segment, and reverse its direction to
   allow for a hidden lock stitch

   ![Screen shot of end of top segment of sun](/assets/images/tutorials/software-freedom-day/SFDTutorial13.png)

   For each of these segments, choose `Extensions>Ink/Stitch>Params` and ensure
   they are stitched in the correct direction. For all but the starting segment,
   ensure the stitch density is uniform and there is a Zig-zag underlay. If the
   stitch density is not uniform, add additional nodes to make it uniform. For
   all segments apart from the starting and end segments, ensure there are no
   lock stitches.  For the starting segment ensure there is a beginning lock
   stitch, and for the ending segment, ensure there is a final lock stitch

9. For each of the rays, break up the paths into two lines with an equal number
   of nodes.  Add a starting segment with a beginning lock stitch on the portion
   of the ray furthermost from the sun. Create a reversed ending segment with
   only an ending lock stitch on the portion of the ray closest to the sun.

10. For each of the letters, break up the paths into two lines with an equal
    number of nodes.  Add a starting segment with a beginning lock stitch.
    Create a reversed ending segment with with only an ending lock stitch.

    ![Screen shot of a letter showing dotted starting, middle and reversed ending segments](/assets/images/tutorials/software-freedom-day/SFDTutorial16.png)

11. If the embroidery machine used supports automatic stitch trimming, add these
    for each ray by using
    `Extensions>Ink/Stitch>Commands>Attach Commands to Selected Objects>Trim thread after sewing this object`.

12. Add a new layer with the license information

    ```

    https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/
    Modified for embroidery from the originals
    https://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org/Logos
    ```

    Choose `Extensions>Ink/Stitch>Commands>Add Layer Commands...` and ignore the
    layer for stitching but leave it visible.

13. Embroider a sample, adjust it as necessary for the embroidery machine used.
    Embroider another sample. If it is ok, embroider a final piece, such as a
    polo shirt.
