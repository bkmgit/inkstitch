From February 2nd to February 6th 2 Ink/Stitch developers had the opportunity to meet 5 Inkscape members in Frankfurt am Main (Germany) at the Inkscape Summit - and it was a really great experience.

Jonathan developed a special gift for us during the meeting. In the future, it will enable us to register changes in Inkscape and, for example, update the simulator accordingly.

It remains to be seen whether this will soon work directly on the canvas (there are still difficulties with macOS and possibly Windows), but even so, we have countless ideas about how we can use the new functionality in the future.

A summary where you can see what everybody was up to during the meeting can be found on the Inkscape website: <https://inkscape.org/news/2025/02/05/inkscape-summit-frankfurt-2025/>
