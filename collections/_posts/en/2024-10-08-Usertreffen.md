In a relaxed atmosphere, we want to explore Ink/Stitch and machine embroidery topics.

Of course, both embroidery beginners and advanced users are welcome.

## Where and when?

**May 7, 2025**<br>
10 a.m. - 6 p.m.

**Unperfekthaus**<br>
Friedrich-Ebert-Str. 18-26<br>
45127 Essen

**Room 304**

The meeting will be held in German.

## Fees

9€ entrance fee for the Unperfekthaus.

This includes any amount of cappuccino, tea, cola, lemonade, spritzers, espresso, cocoa, etc.
Alcoholic drinks and food cost extra.

## Bring along

**Laptops**.

A computer program in theory alone is boring. We want to try things out and test things together.

We are using a developer version for the meeting. It would be great if it was already installed on your laptop. A link to the version will be posted shortly before the meeting.

**Your Ink/Stitch creations**

If you already have experience with Ink/Stitch, please bring along what you have created with Ink/Stitch.

That will inspire us all.

## Contact

If you are interested in the meeting, we would be happy to receive a short info so that we can roughly estimate how many people will come.
