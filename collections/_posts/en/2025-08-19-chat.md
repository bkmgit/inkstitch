Our friends at Inkscape have provided us new communication channels, a forum and a chat.

We would like to invite you all to join in and communicate.

When you are new to Ink/Stitch, you may have many questions on how to get started.

If you already know the program, you might want to help other people to dive into their first embroidery experiences. Get in touch with developers or find out about new or advanced features.

Whatever your goal is, it'd be nice to meet you here.
