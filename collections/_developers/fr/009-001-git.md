## Use The GitHub Website To Work on Ink/Stitch

* Create a branch

  <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch>

* Make changes to your branch with the GitHub editor

  <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files>

* Create a pull request

  <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request>

## Create A New Branch And Upload Changes With Git

* **Clone repository**

  for full manual setup see instructions for your operating system: [Linux/macOS](/developers/inkstitch/manual-setup/), [Windows](/developers/inkstitch/windows-manual-build/)

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/inkstitch/inkstitch.git
  cd inkstitch
  ```

* **Create and enter into a new branch** (even possible when you already made changes)

  ```
  git checkout -b username/branch-name
  ```

* **View changed files or current branch name**

  ```
  git status
  ```

* **View changes**

  ```
  git diff
  ```

* **Add changes to staging area**

  ```
  git add *
  ```

  Or add specific files only

  ```
  git add path-to-filename.ext
  ```

* **Commit changes**

  ```
  git commit -m 'commit message'
  ```

* **Push changes to a new branch in upstream repo**

  ```
  git push -u origin username/branch-name
  ```

  **Push changes to existing branch in upstream repo** (after usage of git add and git commit)

  ```
  git push
  ```

* **Return to the main branch**

  ```
  git checkout main
  ```

  or whatever branch

  ```
  git checkout username/branch-name
  ```

  If you want to work on the **website** checkout the branch gh-pages

  ```
  git checkout gh-pages
  ```

Ink/Stitch will now build a development release which can be found in <https://github.com/inkstitch/inkstitch/releases> (in approx. 25 minutes).

When you are satisfied with the results, make a pull request (see above).
