## Glyphs

This font contains  {{ font.glyphs.size }} glyphs:

```
{{ font.glyphs | sort | join: ' ' }}
```
{: .font-glyphs }

## Remark 

This font allows  multiline text to be embroidered alternatively from left to right and from right to left.

## Warning

This font is very very tiny.

Such a tinyness is only possible because it is meant to be used with both very thin needles (USA size 8, EUr size 60) and very thin thread (60wt).
Do not use the regular 40wt embroidery thread.

If you do not follow these recommendations, you will probably have lots of embroidering problems.

## Dimensions

At 100%, this font is approximatively 7 mm (1/4 inch) high.

It can be scaled up to 140% (approx 11 mm, 0.4 inch) or scaled down to 60% (approx 4.5 mm, 1/6  inch).
