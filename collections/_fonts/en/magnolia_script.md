Magnolia Small is a variation of this font with different embroidery settings. Pull compensation, density and underlays are different to allow to scale down between 50% (11mm, 0.45 inch) and 25% (5mm ,1/6 inch). That's why in the lettering dialog window, if using Magnolia Small, you will have to pick up a scale between 25 and 50%. 

Contrarly to Magnolia KOR, Magnolia  Small  **MUST** be embroidered with thread and needle smaller than usual.
A USA 8 (EUR 60) size needle, and 60WT thread **MUST** be used.
