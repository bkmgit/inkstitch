Don't try to scale it further down. 

Auberge Small  is a variation of this font with different embroidery settings. Pull compensation, density and underlays are different to allow to scale down between 55% (28mm,  1 inch) and 25% (12mm ,1/2 inch). 

That's why in the lettering dialog window, if using Auberge Small, you will have to pick up a scale between 25 and 55%. 

Contrarily to Auberge Marif, Auberge Small font **MUST** be embroidered with thread and needle smaller than usual.
A USA 8 (EUR 60) size needle, and 60WT thread **MUST** be used.

## In real life
