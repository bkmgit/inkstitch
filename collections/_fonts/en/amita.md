## Dimensions

At 100%, this font is approximatively 30 mm high (1.2 inches)

![Dimensions Amitaclo](/assets/images/fonts/Sizing/amitaclosizing.jpg)

Don't try to scale it further down.

Amitaclo small is a variation of this font with different embroidery settings. Pull compensation, density and underlays are different to allow to scale down between 55% (16mm,2/3 inch) and 25% (7mm ,1/4 inch). 

That's why in the lettering dialog window, if using amitaclo small, you will have to pick up a scale between 25 and 55%. 

Contrarily to Amitaclo, Amitaclo small font **MUST** be embroidered with thread and needle smaller than usual.
A USA 8 (EUR 60) size needle, and 60WT thread **MUST** be used.
