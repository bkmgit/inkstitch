```
{{ font.glyphs | sort | join: ' ' }}
```
{: .font-glyphs }

## Dimensions

At 100%, this font  is  approximatively 40 mm (1.5  inch) high.

It may be  scaled up to 250% (approx:  100 mm 4 inches)  but may not be scaled down.

## Too  christmassy for you ?

The µ  glyph has been hacked to store this embroidery ![Brockscript](/assets/images/fonts/brockscriptmu.png)
that contain 4 alternatives to the holly. 

The replacement is up to you, but it is easy in inkscape.

You could also just skip the holly or replace it by any small drawing of your choice.

And if you do not know how to access µ from your keyboard,  copy it from here and paste it in the lettering  dialog window.

## In real life

Brockscript may be used on a Towel ,or a  T shirt, or as an ornament:
