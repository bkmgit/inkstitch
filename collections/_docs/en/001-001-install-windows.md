## Troubleshoot

### Ink/Stitch doesn't show up / is greyed out

**Antivirus Software**

Since Ink/Stitch is packed into a executable there are reports of anti-virus-software using heuristics that mark the extension as a false positive. The solution in this cases is to add the Ink/Stitch extension folder to the exception list on the av program and reinstall the extension and try again.

If your antivirus software deleted files, you will receive an error message like this:

```
Tried to launch: inkstitch\bin\inkstitch
  Arguments: ['inkstitch\bin\inkstitch', '--id=XXX', '--extension=XXX', 'C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Local\Temp\ink_ext_XXXXXX.svgXXXXX']
  Debugging information:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "inkstitch.py", line 35, in <module>
    extension = subprocess.Popen(args, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
  File "C:\Program Files\Inkscape\lib\python2.7/subprocess.py", line 325, in __init__ errread, errwrite)
  File "C:\Program Files\Inkscape\lib\python2.7/subprocess.py", line 575, in _execute_child startupinfo)
WindowsError: [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified
```

**Confirm Ink/Stitch Version**

Verify if you have downloaded Ink/Stitch for Windows ([Download](#download))

**Confirm installation path**

Check if you extracted Ink/Stitch into the correct folder. If the `User extensions folder` doesn't work out correctly, you can also try to install into the `Inkscape extensions folder`.
You can also look it up under `Edit > Preferences > System`.

### PYTHONPATH

There have been reports about an error message starting like this:

```
Python path configuration:
PYTHONHOME = 'C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\inkscape\extensions\inkstitch\bin'
PYTHONPATH = (not set)
```

Reinstall Inkscape. Make sure that "Add to path" is checked, when the PYTHONPATH question pops up during the installation.

### Windows 7: Error message

When you see the following error message please install Microsoft Windows security updates on your computer.

### Windows 8: Error message

![The program can't start because api-ms-win-crt-math-l1-1-1-0.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem](/assets/images/docs/en/windows-install/win8.png)

{: .img-half }

If you come across these two error messages on Windows 8, download and install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022). Choose the file for your system architecture.

### Ink/Stitch is displayed in English

**Incomplete Translation**

It is possible, that not all strings have been translated. This is indicated by **some strings of text beeing in English and others in your native language**.
If you like to complete the translation, have a look at our [description for translators](/developers/localize/).

**Language Settings**

If Ink/Stitch is uncertain, which language to support, it will fallback on English.
You can tell Inkscape explicitly to use your native language as follows:
  * Go to Edit > Preferences > Interface (Ctrl + Shift + P)
  * Set your language
  * Restart Inkscape
