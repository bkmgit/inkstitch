Try the following steps in order to test the extension and to learn the basic functionality.

**Tip:** If you are new to Inkscape, have a look at their [Basic Tutorial](https://inkscape.org/en/doc/tutorials/basic/tutorial-basic.html) first.

## Step 1 - Draw an Object

Create an object, e.g. a circle and make sure it has a fill.

## Step 2 - Parametrize SVG Path for Embroidery

* Select at least one object.
* Open `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params`.
* Play with the values. The simulator will update whenever you change the settings.
* For now, close without saving.

## Step 3 - Create the Embroidery File

* Run `File > Save a copy...`
* Navigate to the folder where you would like to save the file
* Choose the correct file format for your machine
* Click `Save`
* Copy the file to your embroidery machine

**Tip:** Make sure to save the file as an SVG file as well. Then you will always be able to modify it easily.

## Workflow

If this worked well, we recommend to also read through the next page (workflow). Where you can get a deeper insight into Ink/Stitch and you can learn how to perform essential functions for embroidery files, like e.g. ordering objects, etc.

If you run into trouble, contact us through [GitHub](https://github.com/inkstitch/inkstitch/issues/). We really like to hear about your problem, this way we can either improve the documentation or the program itself.
