## What it is

![Contour fill detail](/assets/images/docs/contour-fill-detail.jpg)

Contour fill covers areas with stitches following the contour of an object.

## How to Create

Create a **closed path with a fill color**.

## Set Start and End Point

Set start and end points for autofill objects with [Visual commands](/docs/commands/).

## Params

Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params`. Set fill method to `Contour Fill` and tweak the settings to your needs.

Settings||Description
---|---|---
Automatically routed fill stitching| â˜‘ |Must be enabled for these settings to take effect.
Fill method                        |Contour Fill|Contour Fill must be selected to sew spiral lines of the contour
Contour Fill Strategy              |![Inner to Outer](/assets/images/docs/contour-fill-innertoouter-bottlenecks.jpg)<br>![Contour spirals](/assets/images/docs/contour-fill-spirals.jpg)|**Inner to outer** (default) is able to fill shapes with bottlenecks<br>**Single spiral** fills a shape with a single spiral from the outside to the inside<br>**Double spiral** fills a shape with a double spiral, starts and ends at the outside border of the shape.
Join Style                         |Round, Mitered, Beveled |Method to handle the edges when the size the contour is reduced for the inner spirals
Avoid self-crossing                |![Avoid self crossing effect](/assets/images/docs/contour-fill-self-crossing.jpg)|Wheter inner to outer is allowed to cross itself or not
Clockwise                          ||Direction to move around the contour
Maximum fill stitch length         ||The length of each stitch in a row. "Max" is because a shorter stitch may be used at the start or end of a row.
Spacing between rows               ||Distance between rows of stitches
Running Stitch tolerance           |![Tolerance Sample](/assets/images/docs/contourfilltolerance.svg) |All stitches must be within this distance of the path.  A lower tolerance means stitches will be closer together.  A higher tolerance means sharp corners may be rounded.
Allow lock stitches                ||Enables lock stitches in only desired positions
Force lock stitches                ||Sew lock stitches after sewing this element, even if the distance to the next object is smaller than defined in the collapse length value in the Ink/Stitch preferences.
Tack stitch                        ||Chose your [favorite style](/docs/stitches/lock-stitches/)
Lock stitch                        ||Chose your [favorite style](/docs/stitches/lock-stitches/)
Trim After                         ||Trim the thread after sewing this object.
Stop After                         ||Stop the machine after sewing this object. Before stopping it will jump to the stop position (frame out) if defined.

## Underlay

Underlay in Countour Fill doesn't follow the contour, but uses the fill angle which can be defined in the [fill underlay params](/docs/stitches/fill-stitch#underlay).
