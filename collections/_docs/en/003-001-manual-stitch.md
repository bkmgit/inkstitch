## What it is
[![Manual Stitch Flowers](/assets/images/docs/manual-stitch.jpg){: width="200x"}](/assets/images/docs/manual-stitch.svg){: title="Download SVG File" .align-left download="manual-stitch.svg" }
In manual stitch mode Ink/Stitch will use each node of a path as a needle penetration point, exactly as you placed them.

## How to Create

1. Create a path. Line style or width are irrelevant.
2. Open `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params`.
3. Chose `Manual stitch placement` as the method.

Each node of a path represents a needle penetration point. It doesn't care about bezier curves.

![Manual Stitch Placement](/assets/images/docs/manual-stitch-placement.png)

A clean representation of your manual stitch path can be achieved as follows:
1. Select all nodes (`F2` then `Ctrl`+`A`)
2. Click on ![Make selected nodes corner](/assets/images/docs/tool-controls-corner.jpg){: title="Make selected nodes corner" } in the `Tool Controls Bar`.

## Params

Open `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params` to change parameters to your needs.

---|---
Running stitch along paths    |Must be enabled for these settings to take effect.
Method                        |Choose manual stitch
Bean stitch number of repeats |◦ Enable [Bean Stitch Mode](/docs/stitches/bean-stitch/)<br />◦ Backtrack each stitch this many times.<br />◦ A value of 1 would triple each stitch (forward, back, forward).<br />◦ A value of 2 would quintuple each stitch, etc.
Max stitch length             |Stitches longer than this will be subdivided. Leave empty for no subdivision. 
Minimum stitch length         |Overwrite global minimum stitch length setting. Shorter stitches than that will be removed.
