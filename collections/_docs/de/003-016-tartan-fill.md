## What it is

[![Tartan Fill Sample](/assets/images/docs/tartan-fill.jpg){: width="200x"}](/assets/images/docs/tartan-fill.svg){: title="Download SVG File" .align-left download="tartan-fill.svg" }
Tartan is a patterned fabric with colored horizontal and vertical stripes. It is typically known from scottish kilts. The embroidery stitch type tries to mimic the typical pattern.

## How to Create

* Create a **closed path with a fill color**. The shape may have holes.
* Open the tartan extension under `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Tools: Fill > Tartan` and create your own tartan pattern
* You can update and change more stitch params in the params dialog (`Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Params`)

## Edit Tartan Patterns

The Tartan Pattern Editor can be found in `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > Tools: Fill > Tartan`

[Read more about the Tartan Stripe Editor](/docs/fill-tools#tartan)

## Params

Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Params` to tweak the settings to your needs.
