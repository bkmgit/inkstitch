    title: "Multilingual, Cross Platform, Free and Open Source"
    excerpt: "The goal of the Ink/Stitch project is to put free, high-quality embroidery design tools in the hands of folks that might normally not have access to such tools.
              Therefore we want to make it easy for everyone to use:

              * Multilingual: user interface in several languages ([Help appreciated](https://translate.inkstitch.org))

              * Cross platform: Ink/Stitch is available for Linux, Windows and macOS.

              * Licensed under the [GNU GPL version 3.0 or later](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0).
                This means it will always be free for everyone to use, share and contribute.<br><br>

                It doesn't mean that it goes without cost for contributors.
                Donations for the work and expenses we've put into the programm will be welcome -
                once we've figured out how finances can be organized.

    title: "Lettering"
    excerpt: "With Ink/Stitch you have access to an easy to use lettering system with a long list of fonts ready to use.


              The [lettering system](/docs/lettering/) has lots of interesting features:
              
              * Add text directly with your keyboard

              * Choose from numerous pre-digitized [fonts](/fonts/font-library/)

              * Digitize your own fonts and integrate them into the lettering tool (or share with everyone)

              * The lettering tool lets you scale the fonts within the limits the font author has defined

              * Find suitable fonts with font filters which can be used simultaneously:<br>
                **Category filter**: Searching for a specific type of font? The font category filter helps you to find fonts with specific stitch types or styles.<br>
                **Font size filter**: Find the fonts that fit into your design. The chosen font will automatically adapt to the size value entered into the filter.<br>
                **Glyph filter**: Show only fonts with all the necessary glyphs for the given text


             Once the text has been inserted into the document you can modify the paths and embroidery parameters just as you wish.


             Create interesting results with the available tools, for example [Lettering along path](/docs/lettering/#lettering-along-path) or Inkscape [path effects](/tutorials/distort/) such as envelope deformation.

    excerpt: "Explore the [stitch types](/docs/stitch-library/) available in Ink/Stitch and open up a world of creative possibilities.


              * **[Manual stitch placement]((/docs/stitches/manual-stitch/))**: place each stitch exactly where you want it

              * **Stroke stitch types**:
                [running stitch](/docs/stitches/running-stitch/),
                [bean stitch](/docs/stitches/bean-stitch/),
                [ripple stitch](/docs/stitches/ripple-stitch/),
                etc.<br>
                Create patterned lines with the Inkscape path effect [pattern along line](/tutorials/patterned-unning-stitch/).<br>
                Generate a [cutwork](/docs/cutwork/) or [redwork](/docs/stroke-tools/#redwork) pattern.

              * **Satin stitch types**: [satin](/docs/stitches/satin-column/), [E-stitch](/docs/stitches/e-stitch/), [S-stitch](/docs/stitches/s-stitch/), [zig-zag satin](/stitches/zigzag-satin-stitch/), etc.<br>
                Use various routines to generate satin stitches. Add underlay as necessary. Define randomization options or customize split stitches.<br>
                A special highlight is the possibility to easily generate [multicolor satins](/docs/satin-tools/#multicolor-satin).

              * **Fill stitch types**:
                [fill]((/docs/stitches/fill-stitch/)),
                [circular fill](/docs/stitches/circular-fill/),
                [contour fill](/docs/stitches/contour-fill/),
                [guided fill](/docs/stitches/guided-fill/),
                [linear gradient fill](/docs/stitches/linear-gradient-fill/),
                [meander fill](/docs/stitches/meander-fill/),
                [tartan fill](/docs/stitches/tartan-fill/),
                etc.<br>
                Adjust stitch length, row spacing and row angle among other options.
                Use underlay as necessary.


              Custom [Patterns](/docs/stitches/patterns/) can be applied to all available stitch types.


              Each stitch type comes with it's own set of tools ([stroke tools](/docs/stroke-tools/),
              [satin tools](/docs/satin-tools/), [fill tools](/docs/fill-tools/))
              for conversion, optimization and routing.
